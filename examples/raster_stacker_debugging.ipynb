        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Geo Engine to process raster and vector data to to train an external Random-Forest model for field-use classification.\n",
        "The generation of the training data is dnoe in the Geo Engine.\n",
        "The model is trained using sklearn in this notebook.\n",
        "Then, the model is applied to Sentinel-2 data queried from the Geo Engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Use-Case\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial information of field-use is very important for various applications like yield estimation.\n",
        "Using Earth Observation (EO) data we can generate large raster maps of crop type or field-use.\n",
        "In this notebook, we want to generate such a map for an area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany.\n",
        "To generate such a map, we need ground truth data, e.g. sampling points where the real field-use is known.\n",
        "Then, we can train a Maschine Learning (ML) modell on the sample points and the corresponding values of the EO data.\n",
        "The trained model can then be applied to the whole area to generate a map of the field-use.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we use the following data:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### EuroCrops (NRW, Germany)\n",
        "\n",

        "It is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n",
        "The data can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/maja601/EuroCrops#vectordata_zenodo).\n",
        "This dataset contains field polygons with different classes e.g. the crop type or the usage of the field.\n",
        "For the demo presented in this notebook, we convert the field polygons into points and use them as sample-points.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Sentinel-2\n",
        "\n",
        "The Sentinel-2 data we use is available from the Element 84 Sentinel-2 L2A Data Hub.\n",
        "Using the STAC API, it can be queried for areas and times of interest.\n",
        "The data is available under the [ESA Data License](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/690755/Sentinel_Data_Legal_Notice).\n",

        "3. Build the workflow for cloud-free monthly means of Sentinel-2 data and derive the NDVI.\n",
        "4. Attach the aggregated Sentinel-2 to the points of interest.\n",
        "5. Train a Random-Forest model to classify the field usage based on the Sentinel-2 data attached to the points.\n",
